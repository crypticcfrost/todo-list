# SCADA Network Administration Visualization
SCADA Network Administration Visualization project is an advanced, interactive network monitoring and management tool built with modern web technologies. It provides administrators with a real-time, visually intuitive interface to oversee the critical infrastructure of SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems.

# Key Features:
1. Dynamic ReactFlow Canvas:

- A responsive and interactive visualization of network topology using ReactFlow.
- Nodes and edges represent routers, switches, endpoints, and data links, enriched with real-time statuses and animations.

2. Simulated Network Behavior:

- Automatic and manual simulations of key network events like:
- Data flows visualized with animated edges.
- Unauthorized device detection with alert generation.
- Node/device addition and removal with precise placement.
- Data transfer failures leading to flashing alerts and frozen pipelines.

3. Real-Time Alerts and Logs:

- Alerts for critical incidents such as unauthorized devices and data failures.
- Comprehensive logs to track network changes, offering administrators full transparency.

4. Pipeline Freeze Simulation:

- A realistic emulation of network failure scenarios where operations are paused until resolved, highlighting the urgency of critical failures.

5. Interactive Admin Controls:

- One-click simulations for data flows, failures, and unauthorized access scenarios.
- Real-time addition and removal of SCADA endpoints with geolocation integration.

6. Engaging User Experience:

- Framer Motion-powered animations for smooth transitions.
- Realistic logging out animation, reflecting high attention to user-centric design.

7. Error Resilience:

- Safeguards against removing essential SCADA endpoints, ensuring network integrity.
- Clear feedback mechanisms with toast notifications for every action.

# Technology Stack:

- **React.js:** For a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **ReactFlow:** For visually stunning, interactive network graphs.
- **Framer Motion:** For sleek animations that enhance the user experience.
- **React-Toastify:** For real-time notifications.
- **Next UI + Tailwind CSS:** To achieve a clean, modular design.

# Purpose and Applications:
_This project is designed for network administrators who manage SCADA systems in industries like energy, water, transportation, and manufacturing. It helps:_

- Visualize complex network topologies at a glance.
- Simulate and respond to network events to maintain system resilience.
- Foster proactive monitoring to avoid catastrophic failures.

# Vision:

The SCADA Network Administration Visualization is more than a tool — it’s a step towards modernizing how we manage critical infrastructure. With its rich feature set and real-time interactivity, it transforms network administration into an efficient, intuitive, and seamless experience.
